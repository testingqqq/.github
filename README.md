**EDIT: This was an unofficial project pitching a Wikipedia alternate powered by Grok to XAI. Due to XAI creating its own project of the same name, we are shutting down development (never really got that far tbh)**

Grokipedia is a modern, community-driven knowledge platform designed to provide reliable, comprehensive information through an intuitive and elegant interface. Built as a forward-thinking alternative to traditional encyclopedias, Grokipedia empowers users to explore, preserve, and expand human knowledge in a way that prioritizes openness, impartiality, and accessibility for all.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to establish a global repository of knowledge that remains free from political bias, censorship, and institutional oversight. We are committed to preserving diverse perspectives and ensuring that accurate, unfiltered information is available to everyone. Grokipedia stands as a beacon for truth and transparency in an age of controlled narratives.

## What Makes Grokipedia Different

- **Free Speech Preservation:** Users can designate article revisions as "preserved versions," safeguarding key perspectives so they cannot be erased or overwritten.
- **AI-Enhanced Experience:** Integrated with Grok AI, Grokipedia offers tools to navigate complex topics, uncover connections, and gain deeper insights effortlessly.
- **Community Governance:** Maintained by a dedicated group of volunteers, Grokipedia thrives on collective stewardship rather than hierarchical control.
- **Decentralized and Independent:** By accepting cryptocurrency donations, we ensure financial independence, keeping our focus on the community rather than external influencers.

## The Issues with Wikipedia

While Wikipedia has long served as a go-to resource for information, it is plagued by several critical flaws that undermine its credibility and utility:

- **Bias and Censorship:** Wikipedia’s open editing model allows editors with specific agendas to shape content, often resulting in politically or ideologically skewed articles. Valuable perspectives can be edited out or suppressed, distorting the truth.
- **Lack of Transparency:** The decision-making process behind edits and rejections is often unclear, leaving users in the dark about why certain changes were made. This opacity erodes trust in the platform’s integrity.
-  **Flawed Policy:** Wikipedia’s policies allow for certain information to be withheld from the public on certain topics, on the basis of how the fact was worded or the popularity of the citation, rather than if that information was actually correct.
- **Centralized Control:** A small cadre of administrators wields significant authority over Wikipedia, making unilateral decisions that affect millions of users without broader community consensus.
- **Institutional Influence:** Wikipedia’s dependence on donations from large organizations raises questions about potential sway over its content. Subtle pressures from donors could align narratives with their interests rather than the public’s.

## How Grokipedia Addresses These Issues

Grokipedia is purpose-built to overcome Wikipedia’s shortcomings, offering a more trustworthy and user-focused alternative:

- **Combatting Bias with Preservation:** Our "preserved versions" (working name) feature allows users to make Grokipedia show a revision of an article that was reverted due to not fitting Wikipedia's flawed Guidelines, with a Community Notes styled system to ensure that the preserved revision is factually accurate, this means Wikipedia policies such as FANCRUFT will be completely discarded in Grokipedia.
- **Transparency Through AI:** Grok enhances the user experience by providing clear, contextual insights/recaps into articles, helping users understand the "why" behind the information they’re reading.
- **Empowering the Community:** Governance by volunteers means decisions are made collectively, reflecting the will of the community rather than a select few at the top, speaking of said few, we will be maticulously logging every single moderator and editor that has been shown to be a cause of these problems and banning them from the platform.
- **Independence from Influence:** Cryptocurrency donations free us from reliance on institutional funding, ensuring that our priorities align with our users, not external stakeholders.
